### Life
- TODO Lists
- [x] 1: Cook beef ✅ 2024-01-30
### Self-development
## Summarization

- A boring but tiring day :( 
- My ID card expired and I am not able to use WeChat to make the payment. But luckily the Alipay is still working (I thought I can't use it due to the warning messages sent from the system)
-  **Bought the flight ticket!!!**
	- only for coming back to China: departure on the *7th of February* 
## Lesson Learned
- be careful when using `git commit -am` after using `git reset --soft`
	- some unstaged files might be committed by accident
- `sed` command can be used to
	- delete certain lines, e.x. `sed -e "21d;34,99d`
	- insert contents in certain file to given line, e.x. `sed -e "{line_no}r ${file}`
