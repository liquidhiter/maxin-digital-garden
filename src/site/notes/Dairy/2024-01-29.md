## Planning 
### Work
- TODO Lists
- [ ] 1: #TODO `phy_change` issue
	- it is still under investigation
		- learned trick
			- all PHY settings are saved in the MDM registers, which can be dumped to check PHY settings are correct or not
- [ ] 2. #TODO `rfcore` infrastructure (needs to finish everything on hand)
	- didn't have time to continue on it
- [x] #task 3. investigate the failing test cases in the `generic_ble_phy` âœ… 2024-01-29
	- seems that wrong registers are read in the `rfSettingsCheck.c` file: when are values written to the `RFE_RAM` copied into the `RFE` registers, will it happen?
### Life
- TODO Lists
### Self-development
- TODO Lists
- [ ] 1: continue the Python Deep Dive
## Summarization
- `RXTIMEOUT` determines the timeout for searching for the `sync word`
- `RX` listening window lasts for the time determined by the length field of the packet header
	- sometimes it can last longer than expected if the length field is received incorrectly (e.x. large wrong bits)
