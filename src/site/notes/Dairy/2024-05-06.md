## Planning 
### Work
- TODO Lists
- [ ] 1: clean the code and PR to make it ready for review
- [ ] 2. finishing the docker infrastructure
	- user needs to be the same as the host
	- folder structure needs to be the same to avoid the dbgid issue (source file path)
	- git ssh credential is directly copied into the docker image
		- an ok solution for local development
	- [ ] there might need another dockerfile for CI use
- [ ] 3. create a confluence page for Zephyr
### Life
- TODO Lists
- [ ] 1: shopping in Meny or other supermarkets
### Self-development
- TODO Lists
- [ ] 1: training at home (650K)
- [ ] 2. continue studying on FreeRTOS source code
