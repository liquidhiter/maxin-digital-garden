Welcome to my personal blog.

My preferred name is **Maxin** (combination of min and max, **min** is my given name). I am originally from [Anhui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui), but grew up in [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai). I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology), [KU Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KU_Leuven) and [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTH_Royal_Institute_of_Technology). I am currently working as a software engineer in Texas Instruments in Norway. Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games (PC, PS5 and Switch), reading books(science fiction, suspense novels, etc), watching movies and photographing (beginner level) etc.

I create this blog to:

- share learning notes (as a programmer, it is vitally important to keep learning)
- share thoughts on technical things and life
- share photos
